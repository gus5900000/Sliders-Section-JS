# Scroll Sections Project

This project enables smooth scrolling through multiple sections of a webpage using JavaScript. The scroll is triggered by the mouse wheel, navigating between pre-defined sections with smooth transitions.

## Features

- Scroll up or down to navigate between sections.
- Smooth scrolling effect when transitioning between sections.
- Configurable sections using an array of section IDs.

## How It Works

- JavaScript listens for the `wheel` event to detect scrolling.
- Depending on the scroll direction (up or down), it navigates to the next or previous section.
- The scrolling behavior is smooth, providing a seamless user experience.
  
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your sections to the `elementScroll` array in the `script.js` file.
3. Open the `index.html` in a browser and use your mouse wheel to scroll through sections.
